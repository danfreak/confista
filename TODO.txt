List of items that will improve Confista:

* Nice scheduling UI in the admin (???), so that
  talks can be easily dragged and dropped rather
  than filling up a form.

* Id-card generation mechanism.

* Probably a CMS instead of using Flatpages.

* Talk Tag-clouds

* Comments (Threaded-comment is already available in Pinax).

* Admin actions for some common processes.

* Wiki. Pinax already has a wiki but most conferences might
  require powerful wikis. To be frank, I haven't used the 
  in-built Pinax wiki. It might just fit in perfectly.

* Other items...(will add them as and when I recollect).
